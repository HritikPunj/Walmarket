# Iteration 1 Retrospective

## Introduction
In iteration 1, we created an initial version of our android app, and implemented a couple of features.
Users can view the items that are in the database, and search for items by name.
We pushed the user story regarding searching by category to next iteration. Currently, we just have a stub 
database, which is an arraylist of items, and we are working on making a real database for next iteration for
full functionality.

## Success Highlights
We are happy with the outcome of our first iteration and the product we have developed. Our success can be attributed 
to our diligent planning and thoughtful design strategies prior to diving into coding. As beginners with Android Studio, 
we took the time to familiarize ourselves with the IDE and embraced the challenge of building the application from scratch.
We managed working with version control quite well, answered each others queries, and tried to add good quality documentation
for better understanding and maintainability. The initial app we have created has met our expectations, marking a promising 
start to our project.

## Challenges
 1. **Little too ambitious:** We were a little too ambitious and overconfident in our skills, and did not realized the learning required for implementation. 
 2. **Did not define some stuff in detail:** Although we had some really good discussions about the design of our app but we did not define everything in detail.
 For example - while discussing about a particular developer task we only defined details at a high level, and not had a in-depth discussion about the actual 
 implementation. 
 3. **Mis-estimated time requirements:** We underestimated time requirements for individually assigned tasks. For some tasks this led to insufficient time for 
 testing and debugging, in case we encountered a bug.
